Release notes for 1.3.

This is mostly a catch-up release, since it's been so long since we cut the
last release.  New stuff includes:

1. Updated most of the third party packages.

2. Addition of the automated test system (ats), which allows a series of tests
   to be performed on Spheral++ which automatically determine pass/fail.  See
   the building/testing documentation for the procedure for invoking the
   automated tests.

3. Generalized the method by which physics packages set up and evolve their
   state.

4. Optimization improvements.

5. We now support building on Mac OS X machines.

6. Many bugfixes.

7.  A whole host of stuff over the past couple of years...

Release notes for Optimization-1 release of Spheral++.

1. Some minor code changes that reduce our run-time by roughly 25%-30%.  This
   also makes the run time on the P4 based MCR cluster roughly equivalent to
   what we see on the new PowerPC chips in Berg.

2. Simplifying configuration by creating default compiler sets for different
   platforms, which can be selected with the --with-compilers configure flag.
   Hopefully this removes the onus of setting a bunch of individual compiler
   choices on suppported platforms.

3. Initial support for building with intel C++ (icc) on intel linux.

4. Adding TAU as a third party package, and implemented TAU timers throughout
   the code.  This also includes PAPI support via the TAU timers.

5. Adding a new optionally built package (CXXTests, built with --with-cxxtests)
   which builds C++ source for a set of unit test problems.  Currently these are
   the src/src/Field/tests/testNodeIterators.py and 
   src/src/Field/tests/testIndexFieldLists.py
