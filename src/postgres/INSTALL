1. Install PostgreSQL

2. Create database user(s)
   As the postgres user, type 
   
   createuser username

   where username is the name of the user you would like to add.  Then answer
   all of the questions with 'y'.  This will make your user a superuser, 
   which is necessary to create all of the data structures (which include 
   C functions).

3. Compile SpheralDb.c:
   gcc -c SpheralDb.c
   gcc -shared -o SpheralDb.so SpheralDb.o

   Then put SpheralDb.so wherever you want it to reside.

4. Pre-process the createSpheral.sql script to change the absolute path of
   SpheralDb.so.

5. Create the spheral database.

   createdb spheral

5. Execute the database setup script on the spheral database.

   psql -f createSpheral.sql spheral

6. Run the database test script, testSpheral.sql.

   psql -f testSpheral.sql spheral

7. Rock and roll!!!
