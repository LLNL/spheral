Database Testing
----------------
* See if we can return a 'pass' or 'fail' result for each test instead 
  of just littering the log files.  Maybe a small evaluation program?

Python Testing
--------------
* Get TestDb.py test working.

Spheral Testing
---------------
* Run a simple problem with the database instead of flat files.

This should conclude work on serial spheral.
