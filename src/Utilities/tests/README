These are some random tests for the Timer class. 

Timer_test1.cc is the best one that includes everything. 
The curent Makefile in this directory is set up to compile
this one.  Try:

make; t; cat time.table




The others are more for learning it.  or whatever. 

Here's how you might build/run:

g++ -DTIMER Timer_unmanaged.cc ../Timer.cc ; a.out 

g++ -DTIMER Timer_managed.cc ../Timer.cc;    a.out; cat time.table
g++ -DTIMER Timer_diagnostic.cc ../Timer.cc; a.out; cat time.table
g++ -DTIMER Timer_flop.cc ../Timer.cc ;      a.out; cat time.table

g++ -DTIMER -DMPI Timer_managed_parallel.cc ../Timer.cc -lmpich
mpirun -np 9000 a.out



Not sure if you guys will want to inclue Timer tests in 
some regression suite.  And if so, how you will want
to do it.



To use the PAPI stuff, you have to have that installed on your 
system.  Involves a kernel patch in Linux.  Note that AMD's 
(at least until K7) do NOT have floating-point instruction events,
which just means you can't get FLOP ratings.
