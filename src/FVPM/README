Hi! You're in the Finite Volume Point Method module.

Additional software in this directory:

- gauss_legendre.* 
  This is a C library that has been used for doing Gaussian integration so 
  that this particular wheel doesn't have to be re-implemented for the 1e100th 
  time. The files have .hh and .cc suffixes because I didn't feel like teaching
  Spheral's build system about C files. This code is covered under an LGPL 
  license, and details about copying it appear in gauss_legendre.copying.lib.
