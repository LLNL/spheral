PYB11Generator is a python based code generator that creates [pybind11]{https://github.com/pybind/pybind11} code for binding C++ libraries as extensions in Python. PYB11Generator parses input that is very close to writing the desired interface in native python, turning this into the corresponding pybind11 C++ code.

Note, since PYB11Generator blindly generates C++ pybind11 code, it is essential to understand the pybind11 package itself as well!  In other words, be sure to read and understand the [pybind11 documentation]{https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/} before trying to go too far with PYB11Generator.  The purpose of PYB11Generator is to reduce the burden of writing and maintaining redundant code when working with pybind11 (such as the [trampoline classes]{https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced/classes.html#overriding-virtual-functions-in-python}), and provide a natural syntax for those already familiar with writing interfaces in Python.  However, since the generated pybind11 code produced by PYB11Generator is what is actually compiled by a C++ compiler to create the corresponding python package, any errors reported by the compiler will refer to this generated code, and require understanding pybind11 itself to properly interpret.
