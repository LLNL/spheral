***  Rasmus Villumsen:
***   In Honor to the forgotten polar explorer.
***   He died trying to save Wegener's sorry a..

***  Caltech:
***   There is no gravity, the Earth sucks.

***  Mr. Garibaldi to hapless Engineer: 
***   It is a prototype, it does not have to be perfect,
***   it just has to work.
     
***  Sheridan to Mr. Garibaldi:
***  I am not interested in your problems, 
***   I am only interested in your solutions.
     
***  Sirius Cybernetics Corporation:
***   Share and Enjoy.
***  Its fundamental design flaws are obscured
***   by its superficial design flaws.

***  Urban Dictionary:
***   Stupiphany
***   A sudden, intuitive perception of or insight into the reality or essential meaning of something very basic, 
***   annoyingly obvious, or - in hindsight - really stupid. 
***   The person having the stupiphany is generally greatly excited, while observers just shake their heads at how obvious the answer was.

***  JV Villumsen:
***  The Answer to Life, the Universe and Everything is 42.
***   My dorm room number at Aarhus University was 42.

***  In college I brought the computer system for Western Denmark to it's knees,
***   with a FORTRAN program.
***  For my PhD thesis I used 1200 particles on a single node. PDP 11/60.
***   Now I run 1000000 particles per node on 100000 nodes. Vulcan@LLNL.
***   Eight orders of magnitude.
***  On an observing trip in Chile I was interrogated at gun-point, in Spanish, 
***   about my suspected involvement in an armed bank robbery with fatalities.
***  In Brazil I took a picture of the Danish flag on the building housing the Danish consulate.
***   This building also housed Chase Manhattan offices, so I was detained by security for an hour. Shakedown.
***  On my honeymoon our delicious meal was interrupted by a shooting in the restaurant.
***   The owner limped over to our table and explained that he had been shot by the cook.
***   He apologized for the incident, said he was going to the hospital, but asked us to please enjoy our meal.
***  I need to find out where I can get a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster.
***  In customs at JFK they became suspicious of me, so I was given an astronomy quiz. I passed.
***  To my elementary school teacher, Mrs Hansen, a great teacher. Never raised her voice, quiet authority.
***  To my 7th grade teacher, Mr Christensen, a former sailor, who told the best stories, some of them school appropriate. He made me want to travel the world.
***  To my high school history teacher, Mr. Frederiksen, who taught me critical thinking. Always question everything. The best question is "WHY?".
***  To my high school math teacher, Mr. Mourier, who taught me problem solving skills. Infinite patience.
***  TC Villumsen at 13 y.o.:
***   Mom, Dad does not do any work, all he does is read magazines, play on the computer and talk with his friends.

***  Build, launch, learn, repeat.

***  Nina:
***  I am not a kid, I am a highly sophisticated child.
***  GrandPa, you are weird.

***  Mike Owen:
***  Our simulations are better than reality..

***  Big Bang Theory: Sheldon Cooper:
***  I am a Physicist,
***   I have a working Knowledge of the Universe and Everything in it.

***  Big Bang Theory: Stuart:
***  Like shooting nerds in a barrel

*** The Big Bang Theory
*** Our whole universe was in a hot dense state,
*** Then nearly fourteen billion years ago expansion started. Wait...
*** The Earth began to cool,
*** The autotrophs began to drool,
*** Neanderthals developed tools,
*** We built a wall (we built the pyramids),
*** Math, science, history, unraveling the mystery,
*** That all started with the big bang!
*** Since the "Dawn of Man" is really not that long,
*** As every galaxy was formed in less time than it takes to sing this song.
*** A fraction of a second and the elements were made.
*** The bipeds stood up straight,
*** The dinosaurs all met their fate,
*** They tried to leave but they were late
*** And they all died (they froze their asses off)
*** The oceans said, "Pangaea,
*** See ya, wouldn't wanna be ya!"
*** Set in motion by the same big bang!
*** It all started with the big BANG!
*** It's expanding ever outward but one day
*** It will pause then start to go the other way,
*** Collapsing ever inward, we won't be here, it won't be heard.
*** Our best and brightest figure that it'll make an even bigger bang!
*** Australopithecus would really have been sick of us,
*** Debating how we're here; they're catching deer (we're catching viruses)
*** Religion or astronomy, Descartes or Deuteronomy
*** It all started with the big bang!
*** Music and mythology, Einstein and astrology
*** It all started with the big bang!
*** It all started with the big ... BANG! 

***  Bomb #20: Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this.
***  Doolittle: [frantic] Why don't you have more time?
***  Bomb #20: Because I must explode in 75 seconds. 

***  Bomb, this is Lt. Doolittle. You are *not* to detonate in the bomb bay. I repeat, you are NOT to detonate in the bomb bay! 

***  KISS
***  Keep It Simple Stupid

***  TopGun
***  I feel the need, the urgent need for speed

*** Curiosity Rover
***  Tango Delta Nominal
***  RIMU Stable
***  UHF Strong

***  Toast(On Hawaii Five-0)
***  Your nerd credentials have been verified.

***  This is a prototype of fractal force, it is not supposed to be pretty
***  or fast, it is just supposed to work.
     
***  Code is called repeatedly, it does not remember anything
***  from previous calls except a few useful arrays and the FT of the Green's
***  function for an isolated simulation

***  THAT IS ALL FOR NOW FOLKS
