Version vYYYY.MM.p -- Release date YYYY-MM-DD
==============================================
  * Important Notes:

Notable changes include:

  * New features / API changes:
    * MPI variables are now wrapped as
      ```
      SPHERAL_OP_SUM, SPHERAL_OP_MAX, SPHERAL_OP_MIN
      ```
    * CHAI added as a submodule of Spheral for co-developing features necessary for GPU port.
    * RAJA & Umpire added as first level dependencies.
    * Axom updated to v0.9.0.
    * TPL builds have been split off into a separate Gitlab CI stage to help with timeouts on allocations.
    * Failed ATS runs are automatically retested once in the Gitlab CI.
    * Python execute command is centralized in scripts/spheralutils.py now.
    * Caliper updated v2.11.
    * Adiak added as TPL.
    * Created singleton wrapper for cali::ConfigManger and python wrapped Caliper timer and Adiak routines.
    * New ASPH idealH algorithm implemented, which is much more robust and accurate as H elongations become extreme.
    * New experimental hourglass control algorithm implemented, along with some basic tests/demonstrations.
    * H update algorithms converted to their own independent physics packages, no longer part of the various hydro packages.
    * Physics interface updated slightly:
      * Physics::postStateUpdate now returns a bool indicating if boundary conditions should be enforced again.
      * Physics packages can now have Physics sub-packages, which can be run before or after the main package.  The SpheralController
        now checks for these packages and adds them to the physics package list as needed.
      * Physics packages can indicate if they require Voronoi cell information be available. If so, a new package which computes and
        updates the Voronoi information is automatically added to the package list by the SpheralController (similar to how the
        Reproducing Kernel corrections are handled).
    * Command line options are now consistent. Default values of a string "None" are no longer allowed and any input through the command line of "None" will become the python NoneType None.
    * Cleaned up use of std::any in State objects using a visitor pattern to be rigorous ensuring all state entries are handled properly
      during assignement, equality, and cloning operations. This is intended to help ensure our Physics advance during time integration
      is correct.
    * Converted artificial viscosities to Physics packages, and add them as pre-subpackages to Hydro objects.
    * Split artificial viscosities based on the type of pressure they compute (currently Scalar or Tensor), which is slightly more efficient.
      * This required making the hydro packages evaluateDerivatives into templated methods based on the type of Q they are handed.
      * Also introduced a new base class (ArtificialViscosityHandle), which provides a handle class not templated on the type
        of Q pressure for Hydro objects to hold onto.

  * Build changes / improvements:
    * Distributed source directory must always be built now.
    * Git strategies in the Gitlab CI are fixed so a clone only occurs on the first stage for each job, instead of for all stages for each job.
    * New Gitlab CI pipeline cleanup strategy deletes job directories immediately upon successful completion.
    * The FSISPH package is now optional (SPHERAL\_ENABLE\_FSISPH).
    * The GSPH package is now optional (SPHERAL\_ENABLE\_GSPH).
    * The SVPH package is now optional (SPHERAL\_ENABLE\_SVPH).
    * Cleaner Spheral Spack package.
    * ENABLE\_DEV\_BUILD can now export targets properly.
    * Added a GCC flag to prevent building variable tracking symbols when building PYB11 modules.  This is unnecessary, and
      on some platforms trying to build such symbols is very expensive and in some cases fails.
    * Consolidates lcatstest.in and run\_ats.py into a single spheral\_ats.py script.
    * SPHERAL\_TEST\_INSTALL\_PREFIX now includes the tests directory.
    * Removed most configured files and added a SpheralConfigs.py file to use at runtime instead.

  * Bug Fixes / improvements:
    * Wrappers for MPI calls are simplified and improved.
    * Time step estimate due to velocity divergence in RZ space has been fixed.
    * Fixed tolerances for ANEOS equation of state temperature lookup
    * Clang C++ warnings have eliminated, so the Clang CI tests have been updated to treat warnings as errors.
    * Fix for installing libraries when building individual package with ENABLE\_DEV\_BUILD=On.
    * Bugfix for RZ solid CRKSPH with compatible energy.
    * Parsing of None string now always becomes None python type. Tests have been updated accordingly.
    * IO for checkpoints and visuzalization can now be properly turned off through SpheralController input options.

Version v2024.06.1 -- Release date 2024-07-09
==============================================

  * Important Notes:
    * This is a patch release for v2024.06.0.

  * Bug Fixes / improvements:
    * CD pipeline hotfix for installing release builds on LC machines.
    * Fixes an issue with the use of the axom::quest::SignedDistance interface. 

Version v2024.06.0 -- Release date 2024-06-27
==============================================
  * Important Notes:
    * External users of the code will need to supply config files for tpl-manager to find system libraries correctly. Steps to do this are detailed in the external user build guide. 

Notable changes include:

  * New features / API changes:
    * Added MFV hydro from Hopkins 2015 with extension for ALE options.
    * Adding optional user specified smoothing scale method for SPH, FSISPH, and CRKSPH.

  * Build changes / improvements:
    * PYBind11 libraries no longer depend on the structure of the PYB11 source directory.
      * CMake interface for adding PYBind11 target libraries is modified to more closely match how C++ libraries are created.
      * Multiple Spheral Python modules / CMake targets can be specified for a single directory.
      * KernelIntegrator and FieldList directories are divided into 2 modules / targets.
    * tpl-manager.py will no longer use generic x86_64 configs for non LC systems. Users will be required to supply their own configs for pointing spack at external packages.
    * Spack version is increased from 0.19 to 0.22.
    * Spack upstream is updated.
    * Removed the python 3 module load for the Gitlab CI to fix an issue with pkg-config changing.
    * Zlib target and TPL cmake file is removed.
    * PYB11Generator repo is updated.
    * Spack config and package files inside Spheral are updated to accommodate Spack 0.22.
      * Package recipes for py-numpy-stl, py-pillow, py-pipreqs, td, and tk are removed.
      * Versions for python dependencies in the Spheral spack recipe are fixed and updated (in some cases).

  * Bug Fixes / improvements:
    * Corrected an erroneous VERIFY in the P-alpha porosity constructor (with Fields of porosity and sound speed) that forced runs to stop even with correct input parameters
    * Fixed a bug in the standard ASPH hydros (ASPH, SolidASPH, and RZ varieties) that gave incorrect results.  FSI ad CRK models with ASPH smoothing scales were OK, but standard
      SPH using ASPH smoothing scales were simply incorrect for non-unit aspect ratio H's.  Also added ATS tests to help catch such errors going forward.

Version v2024.01.1 -- Release date 2024-02-17
==============================================
  * Important Notes:
    * This is a patch release for v2024.01.0.

Notable changes include:

  * New features/ API changes:
    * Adding an optional second-stage problem start-up hook to the Physics package interface: Physics::initializeProblemStartupDependencies.  The idea is to keep basic sizing
      of arrays and such in the first stage (Physics::initializeProblemStartup), while this new hook is used for updating any initial Physics state (and therefore provides a
      State and StateDerivatives object).
    * DEM
      * new field list to track max particle overlap
      * user can optional turn off fast time stepping
      
  * Build changes / improvements:
    * Improved the target export functionality.

  * Bug Fixes / improvements:
    * Fixed bug with ConstantBoundary in the presence of porosity with the new porosity models introduced in v2024.01.00.
    * Updating header lists for including Spheral modules in external projects.
    * Adding effective viscous pressure back to FSISPH.
    * Initial volumes for damage models were incorrectly not taking into account pore space when computing failure statistics for seeding flaws.  Fixed.
    * DEM
      * fixed bug in solid boundary unique indices that causes particle sticking
      * fixed bug in solid boundary update policies 
      * fixed solid boundary restartability for moving bcs

Version v2024.01.00 -- Release date 2024-01-19
==============================================
  * Important Notes:
    * The PolyClipper, BLT, and PYB11Generator submodules have been modified. Be sure to recursively update the submodules.  

Notable changes include:

  * New features/ API changes:
    * Adding P-alpha porosity model.
    * Updating treatment of various state variables in the presence of porosity.
    * Introduced a new common base class for porosity physics (PorosityModel), which PalphaPorosity and StrainPorosity share.
    * Revamped interaction UpdatePolicies with FieldLists:
      - UpdatePolicies have a new virtual method: clonePerField: True means when registering a FieldList copy the Policy for each Field in the FieldList; False means register the FieldList for update itself with the single instance of the Policy.
      - This change removes most of our redundant Field/FieldList update policies, and allows us to be more granular in applying different policies to single Field values in a FieldList.
    * Adding more Shadow Python interfaces wrapping our C++ classes, in particular PalphaPorosity and StrainPorosity.
    * EquationOfState now requires instances to provide \partial P/\partial \rho and \partial P/\partial \epsilon.  All current equations of state have been updated accordingly.
    * Tillotson and Gruneisen EOSs implementations updated a bit in the revamping.
    * Added more material options to MaterialPropertiesLib.py (mostly from Melosh's 89 book).

  * Build changes / improvements:
    * Spheral now provides First Class CMake support (using the BLT nomenclature). Spheral and its dependencies are now exported to simplify importing the project. To import Spheral into another project using CMake, use:
      ```
      find_package(Spheral_CXX <path_to_spheral_installation>)
      ```
    * CMake variables have a more consistent naming convention. Unused variables are removed.
    * Added ENABLE_DEV_BUILD option to improve build times during code development.
    * Upped our required C++ standard to 17.

  * Bug Fixes / improvements:
    * Fixed melt behavior in Steinberg-Guinan strength model, which was ignoring melt for damaged material.
    * Fixed range of dimensionless melt temperature for Johnson-Cook strength.
    * FSISPH new features and modifications to method. 
      * NOTE constructor inputs have changed.
      * strength implementation modified.
      * new features added including plane strain option and settable minP for interfaces.
      * new, more rigorous, interface and free surface tracking.
    * Fixed initialization of longitudinal sound speed and Youngs modulus for damage models.
    * Corrected some minor bugs/inconsistencies in the Tillotson EOS.
    * lcats updated to work with current TOSS4 machine configurations.
    * Updated various tests to make out automated testing more robust.

Version v2023-06-0 -- Release date 2023-06-20
==============================================

  * Important Notes:
    * This is the first release using Python 3.
    * Restart files are not backwards compatible with prior releases.

Notable changes include:

  * New features/ API changes:
    * We now use Python 3 rather than Python 2. The conversion from Python 2->3 is larger than most prior Python updates, which is part of why we held off for so long on this conversion. Python 2 is no longer supported however, and most other Python packages are only Python 3 now as well. Python comes with a tool (2to3) which can do most of the work converting a Python 2 script to Python 3, so we recommend when updating one of your old Python 2 run scripts or utilities you first let run 2to3 over that script.
    * FileIO has been simplified in how it handles Fields, which has reduced the API of FileIO.  However, this has two compromises:
      * Restart files are not backwards compatible with older releases.
      * Fields in restart files are pretty much binary blobs, and so are not easily inspected by hand.
    * We have removed support for the Python interface to Gnuplot, since the Python Gnuplot package had significant interface changes. Please convert such interactive graphics to Matplotlib, which has very similar support to our older Gnuplot utilities by importing SpheralMatplotlib.

  * Build changes / improvements:
    * PYB11Generator and PolyClipper are now submodules (in extern/)
    * Converted our PYB11 generator build rules to use the newly provided PYB11Generator Cmake rules.
    * toss_4_x86_64_ib system compatibility.
    * Updated spack version to v0.19.1
    * `--debug` and `--no-spec` options added to tpl-manager.py for outputing debug and skipping `spack spec` step.
    * `--init-only` option in tpl-manager.py will only initialize a local spack instance, skipping any TPL configuration.
    * TOSS4 compatibility for LC systems.
    * "risky" builds are installed on LC machines through gitlab CI.

  * Bug Fixes / improvements:
    * Fixed numerous compiler warnings with newer compilers such as G++ 9.4.
    * r-path for additional TPLs can be propogated to Spheral libraries with `SPHERAL_ADDITIONAL_RPATHS`.
    * The DEM package has received a significant updated.
      * Added simple analytic solid boundaries (planes,cylinder,sphere).
      * User given more control over DEM fast time stepping.
      * Simplified initialization and improved robustness.
