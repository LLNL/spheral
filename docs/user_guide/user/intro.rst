The first thing to know, Spheral is a Python Module
###################################################

Spheral has been developed or deployed as a Python extension, rather than a standalone code.  This is an unusual choice in the world of physics modeling software, which typically exist as standalone software packages with their own interface languages and conventions.  Spheral was developed as a Python extension for a few reasons:

 - Python provides a complete, well-developed, and mature language which many users are already familiar with.

 - It is very convenient to develop sophisticated algorithms in Python for tasks such as laying down your initial conditions in the manner most convenient for your problem at hand.  This provides experienced users with the freedom to develop and experiment with the most effective ways to set up their problems without the necessity of modifying and re-compiling the base code.

 - Python also provides a familiar and  environment for users to analyze, explore, and interpret their simulation outcomes.
