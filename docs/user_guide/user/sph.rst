What are these meshfree modeling methods like SPH?
###################################################

Spheral was conceived as a tool for the development and utilization of meshfree physics modeling algorithms, such as N-body gravitational models and Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH).  SPH began in the astrophysics community which was looking for a method of modeling hydrodynamics coupled with N-body gravity methods.  Since N-body is particle based, it was natural to look for a hydrodynamics method which could also be particle based, and so SPH was born in the late 1970's.  It is useful having a basic grasp of how these sorts of meshfree methods work, so this section will provide a brief introduction.
