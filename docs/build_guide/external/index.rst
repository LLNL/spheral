Building Spheral
################

This guide is designed to help users build and install Spheral external (meaning non-Livermore Computing systems). This guide assumes the user is on a Linux based system.

System Requirements
===================

Spheral has system requirements and recommendations. Many come installed on Linux distributions by default. The package names will vary depending on what distribution you have.
Spheral uses `Spack <https://github.com/spack/spack>`_ under the hood to handle building our Third Party Library (TPL) dependencies.
Users are not required to install Spack themselves, but they can use the `System Prerequisites <https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#system-prerequisites>`_ page for Spack to check the proper system requirements.

.. note::

   Any packages that Spack does not find on the system will be installed through Spack, potentially causing excessively long install times. To avoid this, there are some packages we recommend installing for the system.

Select the following dropdown menu for the appropriate commands to run for a given Linux distribution.

Cloning/Updating

Third Party Libraries (TPLs)
============================

Spheral uses Spack to facilitate building and linking in external Third Party Libraries (TPLs).

Running TPL Manager
-------------------

.. include:: ../include/tpls.rst.inc

.. dropdown:: More ``tpl-manager.py`` details:

   When building TPLs on non-LC systems, ``tpl-manager.py`` will :

   #. Create and activate a Spack environment in ``spheral/scripts/spack/environments`` based on the output of ``spack arch``. All subsequent Spack commands will modify this environment by adding specs, compilers, and external packages to it.

   #. Run ``spack compiler find`` to find system compilers. Spack searches the ``$PATH`` environment variable for compilers and packages. Add any paths to ``$PATH`` to ensure Spack will find them before running ``tpl-manager.py``.

   #. Run ``spack external find`` to try to find existing system installs for things like CMake, Git, Python, and MPICH/OpenMPI (when the spec has ``+mpi``). Be sure to add any packages to your ``$PATH`` before running ``tpl-manager.py``. This can involve using ``module load <module name>`` or similar methods.

   #. Add the current spec to the environment with ``spack add <spec>`` and concretize using ``spack concretize -U``.

   #. Install the TPLs and create the host config file for the given spec with ``spack install -u initconfig <spec>``. The script will print the name of the host config file it created to the terminal. The form will be of the form ``<sys-arch>-<compiler>.cmake``.
