Building Spheral outside of LLNL
#########################################

This guide is designed to help external users build and install Spheral on non LC (Livermore Computing) systems and assumes installation on a debian based system. This guide also expands on some technical information commonly leveraged by users on LC systems. For a more complete understanding, feel free to explore this guide and the LC User Guide. However, for first time users this should be enough to get you started.
